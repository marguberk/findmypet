# FindMyPet - Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Document Information
- **Document Title:** Business Requirements Document
- **Project Name:** FindMyPet
- **Date:** May 11, 2025
- **Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

FindMyPet is a web application designed to help pet owners find their lost pets or allow people who find lost pets to connect with their owners. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and searching pet listings with geolocation capabilities. This document outlines the business requirements, stakeholder needs, and success criteria for the FindMyPet platform.

## Business Background

### Problem Statement
The loss of a pet is a traumatic experience for pet owners, and traditional methods of searching (paper flyers, local community boards) have limited reach. There is a need for a centralized digital platform where pet owners can quickly report lost pets, providing essential information and reaching a wider audience for assistance.

### Business Objectives
1. Provide a platform to help reunite lost pets with their owners
2. Create a community-focused application to increase pet recovery rates
3. Offer additional services that support the pet owner community
4. Generate revenue through advertisements and premium services

### Market Opportunity
According to the American Humane Association, approximately 10 million pets are lost each year in the United States. A platform that can increase recovery rates even by a small percentage would provide significant value to pet owners and the community.

A pet owner can create an account, log in, and create a detailed listing for their lost pet, including description, photos, last seen location, and contact information.

### Use Case 2: Reporting a Found Pet
A person who finds a lost pet can create a listing with details and photos of the found pet, allowing owners to search and potentially identify their missing pet.

### Use Case 3: Searching for Lost/Found Pets
Users can search through listings using filters such as pet type, location, date, and other characteristics to find potential matches.
