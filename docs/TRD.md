# FindMyPet - Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Document Information
- **Document Title:** Technical Requirements Document
- **Project Name:** FindMyPet
- **Date:** May 11, 2025
- **Version:** 1.0

## Introduction

This Technical Requirements Document (TRD) outlines the technical specifications, architecture, and implementation details for the FindMyPet platform. The document is intended for the development team, system architects, QA engineers, and technical stakeholders involved in the project.

## System Overview

FindMyPet is a web-based application that helps pet owners find their lost pets by creating listings that can be searched by the community. The application consists of a backend API server built with Flask and a frontend client built with React. The system incorporates geolocation services, user authentication, real-time messaging, and image handling capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The FindMyPet application follows a client-server architecture with the following major components:

1. **Frontend Client**
   - React-based single-page application
   - Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
   - Client-side routing with React Router
   - State management with React Context API

2. **Backend API Server**
   - Flask-based RESTful API
   - JWT authentication
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - File handling for image uploads

3. **Database**
   - SQLite (development)
   - PostgreSQL (production, future implementation)
   - Data models for users, pets, messages, and comments

4. **External Services**
   - OpenStreetMap for mapping
   - Leaflet for interactive maps
   - Email notification service (future implementation)
